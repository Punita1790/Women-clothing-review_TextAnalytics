# Women's clothing review_Text Analytics
Dataset
The dataset that is from Nick Brooks' Kaggle a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce
site, which has  reviews written by customers.In addition, the dataset has been
anonymized, and references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced
with “retailer”. In this project, I would like to classify each review whether it recommends the
reviewed product or not, so the Recommended IND field will be the outcome. The other
supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple
dimensions.

This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables
